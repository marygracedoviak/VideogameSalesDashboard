# Video Game Sales Dashboard
This dashboard was created with the goal of analyzing videogame sales based on different parameters, such as genre, platform and location. 
I used DAX functions to create helpful measures to be used in the graphs. 
I utilized different types of charts and graphs in order to display the data in a way that is both useful and visually appealing.
